    <p class="text_column aboutmetext">Hello, my name is Dean. I have been drawing since I could remember!&nbsp; My inspiration has been Takato Yamamoto (I have a piece tattooed on me) and many online artists that I have followed throughout the years. I have been taking all available art classes since high school, and I have picked up many mediums, from hands-on to digital. My life without drawing is composed of playing video games and reading manga or novels.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column aboutmetext">My favorite medium is digital; I use my iPad as my tool. Although I would say my best work has been painting, Digital is more convenient and on the go, while traditional seems like a lot to tackle. My kitchen would be a mess for every project when I was taking my Elements of Design class! I have touched on character design by making my DnD character a fully fleshed-out character with a background and timeline. I also made a partner for him named Amon, making sure he had as complex a background as the first character. My biggest passion in life is to <em>create</em>. It doesn't necessarily mean only art. Humans create <em>memories</em>, <em>love</em>, and <em>lives</em>. Everyone is an artist one way or another, and I truly believe that from the bottom of my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

They're my kids, and they're my main motivators in whatever I do! Although Moss does love to interrupt my painting by almost stepping on my palette...&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
